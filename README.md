# Driver-Monitoring-System
Developed a driver monitoring system using CNN and Haar cascades on 4,300 augmented images for robust feature
extraction.
Implemented an OpenCV-based pipeline with 2D convolutions and max-pooling for real-time drowsiness detection.
Trained and optimized CNN models with preprocessing techniques, achieving 95% accuracy with high precision, recall,
and F1-score
